  3. Implement the required methods.
  4. Run the tests.
  5. Submit via Git or the learning platform.
- The tests show failing cases and expected behavior. Use tests as documentation.

Assignments and grading

- Grading rubric:
  - Correctness: 60%
  - Tests: 20%
  - Code quality: 10%
  - Documentation and README: 10%
- Use tests to validate correctness. Provide clear commit messages and incremental commits.

Development environment
- Java 17 or newer
- JDK vendor: AdoptOpenJDK, Eclipse Temurin, OpenJDK are fine.
- Build system: Maven 3.8+ or Gradle 7+
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, or Eclipse
- Test framework: JUnit 5
- Mocking: Mockito or similar
- Static analysis: SpotBugs, Checkstyle, or Error Prone (optional)
- Logging: SLF4J with Logback

Recommended setup
- Install JDK 17
- Install Maven or Gradle
- Configure your IDE to use the JDK and import the project
- Enable annotation processing if you use Lombok
- Run mvn test or ./gradlew test to run test suites

How to build and run code
- With Maven:
  - mvn clean install
  - mvn -DskipTests=false test
  - mvn -q exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"
- With Gradle:
  - ./gradlew clean build
  - ./gradlew test
  - ./gradlew run --no-daemon
- Sample run steps:
  1. Open a terminal.
  2. cd to the example project folder.
  3. mvn clean test
  4. mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"
- The example projects include README.md with exact commands.

Running tests and coverage
- Unit tests use JUnit 5.
- Run all tests with mvn test or ./gradlew test.
- Use coverage tools:
  - JaCoCo for code coverage.
  - Report generation:
    - mvn jacoco:report
    - ./gradlew jacocoTestReport
- CI will fail the build if coverage drops below the set threshold.
- Test structure:
  - Unit tests live under src/test/java.
  - Integration tests live under src/integrationTest/java or a separate module.
  - Keep tests fast and deterministic.
- Test naming:
  - Use descriptive test names.
  - Use given_when_then style or methodName_condition_expected.

Logging and diagnostics
- Use SLF4J as facade and Logback as backend.
- Configure logging via logback.xml in resources.
- Keep log levels:
  - ERROR for failures that require action.
  - WARN for potential issues.
  - INFO for key lifecycle events.
  - DEBUG for internal state during development.
  - TRACE for deep troubleshooting.
- Avoid logging sensitive data.
- Use structured logging where possible. Attach context via MDC for request id or user id.
- Tips:
  - Log at the right level.
  - Log exceptions with stack traces.
  - Include minimal context that helps debug.
- Example:
  - logger.info("User {} logged in from {}", userId, ipAddress);

Clean code and refactoring guidelines
- Keep methods short and focused.
- Name variables and methods clearly.
- Use immutability where it makes sense.
- Break classes that do too much.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Apply refactoring techniques:
  - Extract method to reduce complexity.
  - Rename for clarity.
  - Introduce parameter object when you have many parameters.
  - Replace type code with subclasses or enums.
  - Move method to the class that owns the data.
- Use automated tests to protect behavior while refactoring.
- Avoid premature optimization.
- Prefer readable code over clever code.

Refactoring exercises included
- Small refactor tasks tagged by difficulty: easy, medium, hard.
- Each task includes:
  - A codebase with a failing or brittle test.
  - Hints and an expected shape after refactor.
  - Tests that ensure no behavior change.
- Sample tasks:
  - Extract a long switch into polymorphism.
  - Remove duplicated code across modules.
  - Replace boolean flags with strategy pattern.

Git workflow and collaboration
- Use a small-team friendly workflow.
- Branching model:
  - main (stable)
  - develop (integration)
  - feature/* for new features
  - fix/* for bug fixes
  - release/* for release prep
- Commit messages:
  - Use present tense: "Add test for user validation"
  - Keep messages short and descriptive.
  - Use conventional commits if you want automated changelogs.
- Pull requests:
  - Use PR description for rationale.
  - Link to related issues.
  - Run tests in CI before merging.
  - Request at least one review.
- Merge strategy:
  - Use squash merges or merges that preserve history based on team preference.
- Rebase local work to keep history tidy when appropriate.

CI and automation
- Use GitHub Actions for CI.
- Typical workflow:
  - On push or PR, run: mvn -DskipTests=false test, static analysis, jacoco, and build.
  - Run on matrix to support multiple JDK versions if needed.
- Example workflow steps:
  - Checkout
  - Set up JDK
  - Cache Maven/Gradle
  - Run tests
  - Publish coverage report
- Badges:
  - Add build and coverage badges to README.

Coding standards
- Use 4 spaces for indentation or follow the team style.
- Limit line length to 100 chars.
- Place braces consistently.
- Use final for fields that do not change.
- Favor Optional over null where it improves clarity.
- Document public APIs with Javadoc.
- Keep module boundaries explicit.

Example structure of a lecture project
- /lecture-01-java-modern
  - slides.pdf
  - notes.md
  - examples/
    - src/main/java/...
    - src/test/java/...
  - lab/
    - task.md
    - starter-code.zip
    - tests.zip

Sample code snippet (Java)
```java
public class Calculator {
    private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Calculator.class);

    public int add(int a, int b) {
        logger.debug("add({}, {})", a, b);
        return a + b;
    }
}
```
Use tests to lock behavior:
```java
@Test
void addTwoNumbers() {
    var calc = new Calculator();
    assertEquals(5, calc.add(2, 3));
}
```
